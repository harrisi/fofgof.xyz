      <h2>Chromebook as a development machine</h2>

      <p>
      I bought a
      <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/ideapad-3-cb-11igl05/88ipsc31450" title="Lenovo Chromebook 3 at lenovo.com">Lenovo Chromebook 3</a>
      <sup id="#ref-1"><small><a href="#archive-1">a</a></small></sup> 
      at Best Buy for $99 about a month ago instead of the new M2 MacBook Air for $1,200 to see how it would work as a development machine. 
      Being a twelfth of the price, it seemed hard to pass up. I haven't been doing much programming lately but wanted to get back into it for work, 
      and all I had was a 2017 MacBook Pro. There's nothing wrong with it, really; I do my best to take care of hardware and I can't think of the last time I broke a 
      computer or phone. I still wanted some new hardware to get back into the swing of things to mark a moment of progress.

      <p>
      Then I told myself I didn't need to buy fancy new running shoes to run or some sort of polyester-mix outfit to do a push-up.
      <aside>Not that this hasn't stopped me in the past.</aside>
      However, there were actually some problems with my MacBook Pro. The keyboard is starting to feel a bit loose and/or unresponsive, 
      and sometimes keys will be typed twice for one keypress, which is particularly annoying when inputting passwords. The battery life isn't what it used to be. 
      It's heavier and bulkier than I want since I work in various places - at work, on the couch, at coffee shops or bars, and even in my car. 
      I also felt like it was too valuable to be moving around to all those places in its fragile state, 
      even though I know it's only worth a few hundred dollars at this point.<aside>At best.</aside>
      </p>

      <p>
      This lead to a compromise. I needed something cheap, lightweight, and effective. I had seen a

      <sup id="#ref-2"><small><a href="#archive-2">a</a></small></sup> 
      about this laptop and it seemed pretty decent. Most of my work is done in vim so I don't need much. It turns out it's quite capable. 
      I've known that people will use Chromebooks and other budget-friendly hardware as thin clients interacting with a <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr>, 
      but I often work without wifi and my phone's hotspot isn't always the best.

      For a quick comparison, here were my two options:
      <aside>Obviously there are many other options, but narrowing it down to just two ends (ish) of the spectrum seemed easy.</aside>
